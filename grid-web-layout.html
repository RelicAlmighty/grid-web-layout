            <h4>Favorite Quote</h4>
            <p>“Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless, like water. Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the
                cup.
                You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
                Now
                water can flow, or it can crash! Be water, my friend.” <i>- Bruce Lee</i></p>
